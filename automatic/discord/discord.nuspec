### Silent installer bug

There is a bug in the Discord silent installer. After installing when attempting to run Discord, you may receive an error:

A fatal Javascript error occured

```Error: (InconsistentInstallerState) Attempt to install host that is currently running.
current_exe_path:
"\\\\?\\...\AppData\Local\Discord\app-1.0.9166\Discord.exe"
host_install_path: ...\AppData\Local\Discord\app-1.0.9166"
    at Updater._handleResponse
(...\AppData\Local\Discord\app-1.0.9166\resources\app.asar\common...:17)
```

To work around this error:

Run `"C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Discord\*\Discord.exe" --squirrel-firstrun`

(Substitute your username and the current app version in case of any errors.)
